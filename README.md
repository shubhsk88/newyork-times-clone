# New York Times Webpage Clone

This is a copy of the New York Webpage. Here is a link to the original webpage [Link](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html?_r=0)

This website contains an article, footer and sidebar section.

We used float to build the navbar and in the main body we used grid for the layout and flex to align some parts of the layout.

We used the image of the inflation section as a background, and we align the text to it using grid.
