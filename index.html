              CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
              physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment
              at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations,
              venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
            </p>
            <p>
              He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic
              particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead
              he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin
              with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution
              could have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted
              a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the
              speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
            </p>
            <p>
              If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the
              heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged,
              warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the
              wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but
              would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
            </p>
            <p>
              “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the
              page and drew a double box around it.
            </p>
            <p>
              On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported
              that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his
              hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.
            </p>
            <p>
              Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of
              cosmic time with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of
              astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center
              for Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time —
              so-called gravitational waves — the signature of a universe being
              wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a
              trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the
              long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac
              and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.
